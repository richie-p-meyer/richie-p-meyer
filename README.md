# Richard Wilders — SRE-Track Engineer (Python • SQL • Reliability)

**Sparks, NV • On-site & on-call ready**  
Marine Corps veteran (Afghanistan deployment) → incident leadership under real pressure.  
Now building and debugging distributed data systems, automation, and reliability tooling in **Python/SQL** with a clear path to **SRE/DevOps**.

---

## What I Do
- **Troubleshoot complex systems:** trace failures across ingestion → transforms → storage → apps
- **Automate & harden:** Python utilities for health checks, retries, validation, and log analysis
- **Make systems observable:** structured logging, metrics, and quick root-cause workflows
- **Operate under pressure:** calm incident response and clear comms during outages

---

## Featured Projects
### 1) Pipeline Reliability Toolkit (Python)
Resiliency helpers for data pipelines: retry/backoff, schema validation, dead-letter capture, log enrichment.
- **Stack:** Python, Pandas, Pydantic/Marshmallow, Requests/Playwright
- **Highlights:** early-fail input validation, consistent error taxonomy, CLI for rapid triage
- **Link:** `TODO: add repo link`

### 2) Scraper Guardrails for Shifting Sources
Fault-tolerant web data acquisition that survives HTML/API changes and rate limits.
- **Stack:** Python, Playwright, BeautifulSoup, concurrency
- **Highlights:** anti-fragile selectors, health pings, diff-based detectors, exponential backoff
- **Link:** `TODO: add repo link`

### 3) Churn ML Pipeline — Prod-Style Layout
End-to-end pipeline for 10k+ records with modular steps, checkpoints, and monitoring hooks.
- **Stack:** Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Highlights:** reproducible runs, drift checks, schema/version snapshots
- **Link:** `TODO: add repo link`

### 4) LogLens — Quick Root-Cause Explorer
Small CLI to slice logs by time/window/request-id, surface anomaly patterns, and compare healthy vs failing runs.
- **Stack:** Python, rich/typer (CLI), regex, JSONL
- **Highlights:** “last-known-good vs failing” diff, latency spike finder
- **Link:** https://github.com/richie-p-meyer/loglens

## Evidence of Excellence
- **USMC, Afghanistan — mission-critical leadership:** led **40–50 linguists**; time-sensitive ops where actions impacted Marines’ safety. Calm, decisive incident command.
- **Rubik’s Cube innovation:** early **Roux** method tutorials (tens of thousands of views); created the **Meyer Method (4×4)** adopted by top solvers; helped organize **US Nationals 2012** and **Worlds 2013** (Las Vegas).
- **50-mile ultramarathon (undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes):** finished despite severe physical collapse; diagnosed 3 weeks later. Extreme grit under adversity.
- **Ten 10-day Vipassana courses:** 100+ hours per retreat, deep discipline and equanimity under internal/external stress.
